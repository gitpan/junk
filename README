SYNOPSIS
     use 5.010;

         or alarm my $accountant;

DESCRIPTION
    The "junk" module performs two very different tasks depending on whether
    you type "use junk" or "no junk".

  "import"
    "use junk" takes each of its arguments, performs some unescaping on
    each, decodes them as base64, and then passes them each to "eval".

    The unescaping is as follows:

     "_D0"   => "0"
     "_D1"   => "1"
     "_D2"   => "2"
     "_D3"   => "3"
     "_D4"   => "4"
     "_D5"   => "5"
     "_D6"   => "6"
     "_D7"   => "7"
     "_D8"   => "8"
     "_D9"   => "9"
     "_P"    => "+"
     "_S"    => "/"

    This allows base64 to be encoded as Perl barewords (provided you're not
    in strict mode).

    Called with no arguments, it switches off switch mode.

  "unimport"
    "no junk" is equivalent to saying "use strict 'subs', 'vars'".

    I don't know about you, but 'refs' is the only part of strict that I
    ever disable, so "no junk" just enables all of strict except 'refs'.
